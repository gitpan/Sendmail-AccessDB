NAME
    Sendmail::AccessDB - An interface to the Sendmail access.db list

SYNOPSIS
     use Sendmail::AccessDB qw(spam_friend whitelisted);
     $friend_or_hater = spam_friend('user@example.com');
     $whitelisted = whitelisted('sender@example.com');

DESCRIPTION
    This module is designed so that users of the Sendmail::Milter module (or
    other Sendmail programmers) can ascertain if a user has elected to
    whitelist themselves as a "spam friend" (where there should be no spam
    filtering on mail to them) or, where spam-filtering is not the default,
    but an option, where certain receipients have been labeled as "spam
    haters"

USAGE
     use Sendmail::AccessDB qw(spam_friend);
     $friend_or_hater = spam_friend('user@example.com');

    Ordinarily, this will look for such things as "Spam:user@example.com",
    "Spam:user@", etc., in the /etc/mail/access.db file. There is an
    optional second argument "Category", which could be used if you wanted
    to enable specific checks, for example, if you wanted to customize down
    to a per-check basis, you might use:

     $rbl_friend_or_hater = spam_friend('user@example.com','maps_rbl'); 
     $dul_friend_or_hater = spam_friend('user@example.com','maps_dul'); 

    Caution should be taken when defining your own categories, as they may
    inadvertantly conflict with Sendmail-defined categories.

     use Sendmail::AccessDB qw(whitelisted);
     $whitelisted = whitelisted('sender@example.com');
     $whitelisted_host = whitelisted('foo.example.com');
     $whitelisted_addr = whitelisted('192.168.1.123');

    Would check for appropriate whitelisting entries in access.db.

BUGS
    None that I've found yet, but I'm sure they're there.
