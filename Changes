Revision history for Perl extension Sendmail::AccessDB.

0.07  Sat Dec 08
	- Added 'file' argument to lookup() to allow looking up in files
          other than /etc/mail/access.db

0.05  Tue Aug 28
        - Fixed bug where one of the _expand_* private calls was not 
          threadsafe.

0.04  Sun Aug 19
        - Made a generic "lookup" routine, which will return the value of 
          in the DB. 
        - genericised some private function calls for the purpose of finding
          parent lookups for email addresses, ip addresses, hostnames, etc.
        - Made the lookup and whitelisted routines take a 'qualifier' argument
          (e.g., the "Spam" in "Spam:lookup"), as well as to add a 'type'
          argument, where a particular lookup-expansion type (previous change)
          is desired. (e.g., doing a lookup on 'postmaster' is ambiguous, as it
          could be both a hostname and a recipient or sender, and the method
          of determining "parent lookups" for each is different.

0.03  Fri Aug 17 16:46:00 2001
        - Per the sendmail folks, whitelisting lookups now check LHS@ 
          in the DB instead of LHS.

0.02  Fri Aug 17 14:39:00 2001
        - Fixed whitelisting bug where the RHS of an email address wasn't
          scanned to see if parent domains were whitelisted.
